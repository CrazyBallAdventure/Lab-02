        <h3>who am i?</h3>
  <p>My name is Lui, don't ask me about my last name, its not that important xoxo. I'm a 20 year old non-binary person who uses e/em pronouns (they/them is okay as well)
    I'm just a carefree, chillax, fun-loving fellow. I enjoy being whismical and jolly, though i can be a little uncanny. 
	I was born January 29<sup>th</sup>, 2003. I graduated from The Soulsville Charter School in the year (of the devil) 2021.
    Currently I am enrolled in The Collective Blueprint and Code School to further my education on something that I've been interested in for a while.
	Some of my other hobbies are chilling out playing games, drawing my silly little comfort charaters,
    watching the same youtube video on repeat for 3 days, and sleeping.</p>
 <h3> what are my credentials?</h3>
 <p> I've been employeed as a retail worker from June 2021 to August 2022 at Once Upon a Child, and from October 2022 to currently, I work at Krispy Kreme.
    Meaning I'm pretty good at talking to customers and making their experience better in the store. I think I do that pretty well, and I hope to further that 
    skill and assert it into my real life.
